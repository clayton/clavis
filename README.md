# Clavis

Clavis is a Ruby gem that provides an easy-to-use implementation of OIDC (OpenID Connect) and OAuth2 functionality for Rails applications. It focuses on simplifying the "Sign in with ____" experience while adhering to relevant security standards and best practices.

It's unapologetically Rails-first and opinionated. It's not a general-purpose authentication library, but rather a library that makes it easier to integrate with popular OAuth providers.

You should be able to install and go in 5 minutes.

> üîë **Fun fact**: The name "Clavis" comes from the Latin word for "key" - a fitting name for a gem that unlocks secure authentication!

## Quick Start Guide

Get up and running with OAuth authentication in just three steps:

```ruby
# 1. Add to your Gemfile and run bundle install
gem 'clavis'
```

```bash
# 2. Run the installation generator
# This automatically:
#   - Creates the necessary migrations
#   - Creates a configuration initializer
#   - Adds OAuth fields to your User model
#   - Mounts the engine at '/auth' in routes.rb
rails generate clavis:install
rails db:migrate
```

```ruby
# 3. Configure a provider (in config/initializers/clavis.rb)
# The generator created this file for you - just update with your credentials
Clavis.configure do |config|
  config.providers = {
    google: {
      client_id: ENV['GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID'],
      client_secret: ENV['GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET'],
      redirect_uri: 'https://your-app.com/auth/google/callback'
    },
    github: {
      client_id: ENV['GITHUB_CLIENT_ID'],
      client_secret: ENV['GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET'],
      redirect_uri: 'http://localhost:3000/auth/github/callback'
    }
  }
end
```

Then add an OAuth login button to your view:
```erb
<%= clavis_oauth_button :github %>
```

That's it! You now have "Sign in with GitHub" functionality in your Rails app.

## Assumptions

Before installing Clavis, note these assumptions:

1. You're using Rails 7+
2. You've got a User model and some form of authentication already
3. You want speed over configuration flexibility

## Installation

Add to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'clavis', '~> 0.6.2'
```

Install and set up:

```bash
bundle install
rails generate clavis:install
rails db:migrate
```

## Basic Configuration

Configure in an initializer:

```ruby
# config/initializers/clavis.rb
Clavis.configure do |config|
  config.providers = {
    google: {
      client_id: ENV['GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID'],
      client_secret: ENV['GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET'],
      redirect_uri: 'https://your-app.com/auth/google/callback'
    },
    github: {
      client_id: ENV['GITHUB_CLIENT_ID'],
      client_secret: ENV['GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET'],
      redirect_uri: 'http://localhost:3000/auth/github/callback'
    }
  }
end
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: The `redirect_uri` must match EXACTLY what you've registered in the provider's developer console. If there's a mismatch, you'll get errors like "redirect_uri_mismatch". Pay attention to the protocol (http/https), domain, port, and path - all must match precisely.

## Setting Up OAuth Redirect URIs in Provider Consoles

When setting up OAuth, correctly configuring redirect URIs in both your app and the provider's developer console is crucial:

### Google
1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com)
2. Navigate to "APIs & Services" > "Credentials"
3. Create or edit an OAuth 2.0 Client ID
4. Under "Authorized redirect URIs" add exactly the same URI as in your Clavis config:
   - For development: `http://localhost:3000/auth/google/callback`
   - For production: `https://your-app.com/auth/google/callback`

### GitHub
1. Go to [GitHub Developer Settings](https://github.com/settings/developers)
2. Navigate to "OAuth Apps" and create or edit your app
3. In the "Authorization callback URL" field, add exactly the same URI as in your Clavis config

### Common Errors
- **Error 400: redirect_uri_mismatch** - This means the URI in your code doesn't match what's registered in the provider's console
- **Solution**: Ensure both URIs match exactly, including protocol (http/https), domain, port, and full path

## Database Setup

The generator creates migrations for:

1. OAuth identities table
2. User model OAuth fields

## Integrating with Existing Authentication

1. Configure as shown above
2. Run the generator
3. Include the module in your User model:
   ```ruby
   # app/models/user.rb
   include Clavis::Models::OauthAuthenticatable
   ```
4. Add OAuth buttons to your login page:
   ```erb
   <%= clavis_oauth_button :github, class: "oauth-button github" %>
   <%= clavis_oauth_button :google, class: "oauth-button google" %>
   ```

## Controller Integration

Include the authentication concern:

```ruby
# app/controllers/auth_controller.rb
class AuthController < ApplicationController
  include Clavis::Controllers::Concerns::Authentication
  
  def oauth_authorize
    redirect_to auth_url(params[:provider])
  end
  
  def oauth_callback
    auth_hash = process_callback(params[:provider])
    user = User.find_for_oauth(auth_hash)
    session[:user_id] = user.id
    redirect_to after_sign_in_path
  rescue Clavis::Error => e
    redirect_to sign_in_path, alert: "Authentication failed: #{e.message}"
  end
  
  private
  
  def after_sign_in_path
    stored_location || root_path
  end
end
```

## User Model Integration

Clavis delegates user creation and management to your application through a finder method. After installing Clavis, you need to set up your User model to handle OAuth users:

```bash
# Generate the Clavis user methods concern
rails generate clavis:user_method
```

This generates:
1. A `ClavisUserMethods` concern in `app/models/concerns/clavis_user_methods.rb`
2. Adds `include ClavisUserMethods` to your User model

The concern provides:
- Integration with the `OauthAuthenticatable` module for helper methods
- A `find_or_create_from_clavis` class method that handles user creation/lookup
- Conditional validation for password requirements (commented by default)

### Customizing User Creation

The generated concern includes a method to find or create users from OAuth data. By default, it only sets the email field, which may not be sufficient for your User model:

```ruby
# In app/models/concerns/clavis_user_methods.rb
def find_or_create_from_clavis(auth_hash)
  # For OpenID Connect providers (like Google), we use the sub claim as the stable identifier
  # For other providers, we use the uid
  identity = if auth_hash[:id_token_claims]&.dig(:sub)
              Clavis::OauthIdentity.find_by(
                provider: auth_hash[:provider],
                uid: auth_hash[:id_token_claims][:sub]
              )
            else
              Clavis::OauthIdentity.find_by(
                provider: auth_hash[:provider],
                uid: auth_hash[:uid]
              )
            end
  return identity.user if identity&.user

  # Finding existing user logic...
  
  # Create new user if none exists
  if user.nil?
    # Convert hash data to HashWithIndifferentAccess for reliable key access
    info = auth_hash[:info].with_indifferent_access if auth_hash[:info]
    
    user = new(
      email: info&.dig(:email)
      # You MUST add other required fields for your User model here!
    )
    
    user.save!
  end
  
  # Create or update the OAuth identity...
end
```

### OpenID Connect Providers and Stable Identifiers

For OpenID Connect providers (like Google), Clavis uses the `sub` claim from the ID token as the stable identifier. This is important because:

1. The `sub` claim is guaranteed to be unique and stable for each user
2. Other fields like `uid` might change between logins
3. This follows the OpenID Connect specification

For non-OpenID Connect providers (like GitHub), Clavis continues to use the `uid` field as the identifier.

‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT**: You **MUST** customize this method to set all required fields for your User model!

We use `with_indifferent_access` to reliably access fields regardless of whether keys are strings or symbols. The auth_hash typically contains:

```ruby
# Access these fields with info.dig(:field_name) 
info = auth_hash[:info].with_indifferent_access

# Common fields available in info:
info[:email]           # User's email address
info[:name]            # User's full name
info[:given_name]      # First name (Google)
info[:first_name]      # First name (some providers)
info[:family_name]     # Last name (Google)
info[:last_name]       # Last name (some providers)
info[:nickname]        # Username or handle
info[:picture]         # Profile picture URL (Google)
info[:image]           # Profile picture URL (some providers)
```

Example of customized user creation:

```ruby
# Convert to HashWithIndifferentAccess for reliable key access
info = auth_hash[:info].with_indifferent_access if auth_hash[:info]

user = new(
  email: info&.dig(:email),
  first_name: info&.dig(:given_name) || info&.dig(:first_name),
  last_name: info&.dig(:family_name) || info&.dig(:last_name),
  username: info&.dig(:nickname) || "user_#{SecureRandom.hex(4)}",
  avatar_url: info&.dig(:picture) || info&.dig(:image),
  terms_accepted: true
)
```

### Helper Methods

The concern includes the `OauthAuthenticatable` module, which provides helper methods:

```ruby
# Available on any user instance
user.oauth_user?        # => true if the user has any OAuth identities
user.oauth_identity     # => the primary OAuth identity
user.oauth_avatar_url   # => the profile picture URL
user.oauth_name         # => the name from OAuth
user.oauth_email        # => the email from OAuth
user.oauth_token        # => the access token
```

### Handling Password Requirements

For password-protected User models, the concern includes a commented-out conditional validation:

```ruby
# Uncomment in app/models/concerns/clavis_user_methods.rb
validates :password, presence: true, unless: :oauth_user?
```

This allows you to:
1. Skip password requirements for OAuth users
2. Keep your regular password validations for non-OAuth users
3. Avoid storing useless random passwords in your database

### Using a Different Class or Method

You can configure Clavis to use a different class or method name:

```ruby
# config/initializers/clavis.rb
Clavis.configure do |config|
  # Use a different class
  config.user_class = "Account"
  
  # Use a different method name
  config.user_finder_method = :create_from_oauth
end
```

## View Integration

Include view helpers:

```ruby
# app/helpers/oauth_helper.rb
module OauthHelper
  include Clavis::ViewHelpers
end
```

### Importing Stylesheets

The Clavis install generator will attempt to automatically add the required stylesheets to your application. If you need to manually include them:

For Sprockets (asset pipeline):
```css
/* app/assets/stylesheets/application.css */
/*
 *= require clavis
 *= require_self
 */
```

For Webpacker/Importmap:
```scss
/* app/assets/stylesheets/application.scss */
@import 'clavis';
```

### Using Buttons

Use in views:

```erb
<div class="oauth-buttons">
  <%= clavis_oauth_button :google %>
  <%= clavis_oauth_button :github %>
</div>
```

Customize buttons:

```erb
<%= clavis_oauth_button :google, text: "Continue with Google" %>
<%= clavis_oauth_button :github, class: "my-custom-button" %>
```

## Routes Configuration

The generator mounts the engine:

```ruby
# config/routes.rb
mount Clavis::Engine => "/auth"
```

## Token Refresh

Provider support:

| Provider  | Refresh Token Support | Notes |
|-----------|----------------------|-------|
| Google    | ‚úÖ Full support      | Requires `access_type=offline` |
| GitHub    | ‚úÖ Full support      | Requires specific scopes |
| Microsoft | ‚úÖ Full support      | Standard OAuth 2.0 flow |
| Facebook  | ‚úÖ Limited support   | Long-lived tokens |
| Apple     | ‚ùå Not supported     | No refresh tokens |

Refresh tokens manually:

```ruby
provider = Clavis.provider(:google, redirect_uri: "https://your-app.com/auth/google/callback")
new_tokens = provider.refresh_token(oauth_identity.refresh_token)
```

## Custom Providers

Use the Generic provider:

```ruby
config.providers = {
  custom_provider: {
    client_id: ENV['CUSTOM_PROVIDER_CLIENT_ID'],
    client_secret: ENV['CUSTOM_PROVIDER_CLIENT_SECRET'],
    redirect_uri: 'https://your-app.com/auth/custom_provider/callback',
    authorization_endpoint: 'https://auth.custom-provider.com/oauth/authorize',
    token_endpoint: 'https://auth.custom-provider.com/oauth/token',
    userinfo_endpoint: 'https://api.custom-provider.com/userinfo',
    scopes: 'profile email',
    openid_provider: false
  }
}
```

Or create a custom provider class:

```ruby
class ExampleOAuth < Clavis::Providers::Base
  def authorization_endpoint
    "https://auth.example.com/oauth2/authorize"
  end

  def token_endpoint
    "https://auth.example.com/oauth2/token"
  end

  def userinfo_endpoint
    "https://api.example.com/userinfo"
  end
end

# Register it
Clavis.register_provider(:example_oauth, ExampleOAuth)
```

## Provider-Specific Setup

Callback URI format for all providers:

```
https://your-domain.com/auth/:provider/callback
```

## Rate Limiting

Clavis includes built-in integration with the [Rack::Attack](https://github.com/rack/rack-attack) gem to protect your OAuth endpoints against DDoS and brute force attacks.

### Setting Up Rate Limiting

1. Rack::Attack is included as a dependency in Clavis, so you don't need to add it separately.

2. Rate limiting is enabled by default. To customize it, update your Clavis configuration:

```ruby
# config/initializers/clavis.rb
Clavis.configure do |config|
  # Enable or disable rate limiting (enabled by default)
  config.rate_limiting_enabled = true
  
  # Configure custom throttles (optional)
  config.custom_throttles = {
    "login_page": {
      limit: 30,
      period: 1.minute,
      block: ->(req) { req.path == "/login" ? req.ip : nil }
    }
  }
end
```

### Default Rate Limits

By default, Clavis sets these rate limits:

- **OAuth Authorization Endpoints (`/auth/:provider`)**: 20 requests per minute per IP
- **OAuth Callback Endpoints (`/auth/:provider/callback`)**: 15 requests per minute per IP
- **Login Attempts by Email**: 5 requests per 20 seconds per email address

### Customizing Rack::Attack Configuration

For more advanced customization, you can configure Rack::Attack directly in an initializer:

```ruby
# config/initializers/rack_attack.rb
Rack::Attack.throttle("custom/auth/limit", limit: 10, period: 30.seconds) do |req|
  req.ip if req.path.start_with?("/auth/")
end

# Customize the response for throttled requests
Rack::Attack.throttled_responder = lambda do |req|
  [
    429,
    { 'Content-Type' => 'application/json' },
    [{ error: "Too many requests. Please try again later." }.to_json]
  ]
end
```

### Monitoring and Logging

Rack::Attack uses ActiveSupport::Notifications, so you can subscribe to events:

```ruby
# config/initializers/rack_attack_logging.rb
ActiveSupport::Notifications.subscribe("throttle.rack_attack") do |name, start, finish, id, payload|
  req = payload[:request]
  
  # Log throttled requests
  if req.env["rack.attack.match_type"] == :throttle
    Rails.logger.warn "Rate limit exceeded for #{req.ip}: #{req.path}"
  end
end
```

## Testing Your Integration

Access standardized user info:

```ruby
# From most recent OAuth provider
current_user.oauth_email
current_user.oauth_name
current_user.oauth_avatar_url

# From specific provider
current_user.oauth_email("google")
current_user.oauth_name("github")

# Check if OAuth user
current_user.oauth_user?
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

The `rails-app` directory contains a Rails application used for integration testing and is not included in the gem package.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and the created tag, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).

## Usage

### Basic Setup

1. Install the gem
2. Run the installation generator:

```
rails generate clavis:install
```

3. Configure your OAuth providers in `config/initializers/clavis.rb`:

```ruby
Clavis.configure do |config|
  # Configure your OAuth providers
  config.provider :github, client_id: "your-client-id", client_secret: "your-client-secret"
  
  # Add other configurations as needed
end
```

4. Generate an authentication controller:

```
rails generate clavis:controller Auth
```

5. Add the routes to your application:

```ruby
# config/routes.rb
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  get 'auth/:provider/callback', to: 'auth#callback'
  get 'auth/failure', to: 'auth#failure'
  get 'auth/:provider', to: 'auth#authorize', as: :auth
  # ...
end
```

### User Management

Clavis creates a concern module that you can include in your User model:

```ruby
# app/models/user.rb
class User < ApplicationRecord
  include Clavis::Models::Concerns::ClavisUserMethods
  
  # Your existing user model code
end
```

This provides your User model with the `find_or_create_from_clavis` method that manages user creation from OAuth data.

### Session Management

Clavis handles user sessions through a concern module that is automatically included in your ApplicationController:

```ruby
# app/controllers/application_controller.rb
class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
  # Clavis automatically includes:
  # include Clavis::Controllers::Concerns::Authentication
  # include Clavis::Controllers::Concerns::SessionManagement
  
  # Your existing controller code
end
```

#### Secure Cookie-Based Authentication

The SessionManagement concern uses a secure cookie-based approach that is compatible with Rails 8's authentication patterns:

- **Signed Cookies**: User IDs are stored in signed cookies with security settings like `httponly`, `same_site: :lax`, and `secure: true` (in production)
- **Security-First**: Cookies are configured with security best practices to protect against XSS, CSRF, and cookie theft
- **No Session Storage**: User authentication state is not stored in the session, avoiding session fixation attacks

#### Authentication Methods

The SessionManagement concern provides the following methods:

- `current_user` - Returns the currently authenticated user (if any)
- `authenticated?` - Returns whether a user is currently authenticated
- `sign_in_user(user)` - Signs in a user by setting a secure cookie
- `sign_out_user` - Signs out the current user by clearing cookies
- `store_location` - Stores the current URL to return to after authentication (uses session for this temporary data only)
- `after_login_path` - Returns the path to redirect to after successful login (stored location or root path)
- `after_logout_path` - Returns the path to redirect to after logout (login path or root path)

#### Compatibility with Existing Authentication

The system is designed to work with various authentication strategies:

1. **Devise**: If your application uses Devise, Clavis will automatically use Devise's `sign_in` and `sign_out` methods.

2. **Rails 8 Authentication**: Compatible with Rails 8's cookie-based authentication approach.

3. **Custom Cookie Usage**: If you're already using `cookies.signed[:user_id]`, Clavis will work with this approach.

#### Customizing Session Management

You can override any of these methods in your ApplicationController to customize the behavior:

```ruby
# app/controllers/application_controller.rb
class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
  # Override the default after_login_path
  def after_login_path
    dashboard_path  # Redirect to dashboard instead of root
  end
  
  # Override sign_in_user to add additional behavior
  def sign_in_user(user)
    super  # Call the original method
    log_user_sign_in(user)  # Add your custom behavior
  end
  
  # Use a different cookie name or format
  def sign_in_user(user)
    cookies.signed.permanent[:auth_token] = {
      value: user.generate_auth_token,
      httponly: true,
      same_site: :lax,
      secure: Rails.env.production?
    }
  end
  
  # Customize how users are found
  def find_user_by_cookie
    return nil unless cookies.signed[:auth_token]
    User.find_by_auth_token(cookies.signed[:auth_token])
  end
end
```

## Configuration

See `config/initializers/clavis.rb` for all configuration options.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

### Integration with has_secure_password

If your User model uses `has_secure_password` for authentication, you'll need to handle password validation carefully when creating users from OAuth. The generated ClavisUserMethods concern provides several strategies for dealing with this:

#### Option 1: Skip Password Validation (Recommended)

This approach adds a temporary attribute to mark OAuth users and skip password validation for them:

```ruby
# app/models/user.rb
class User < ApplicationRecord
  include ClavisUserMethods
  has_secure_password

  # Skip password validation for OAuth users
  validates :password, presence: true, length: { minimum: 8 },
           unless: -> { skip_password_validation }, on: :create
end
```

The `skip_password_validation` attribute is set automatically in the OAuth flow.

#### Option 2: Set Random Password

Another approach is to set a random secure password for OAuth users:

```ruby
# app/models/user.rb
class User < ApplicationRecord
  include ClavisUserMethods
  has_secure_password

  # Set a random password for OAuth users
  before_validation :set_random_password, 
                   if: -> { skip_password_validation && respond_to?(:password=) }
  
  private
  
  def set_random_password
    self.password = SecureRandom.hex(16)
    self.password_confirmation = password if respond_to?(:password_confirmation=)
  end
end
```

#### Option 3: Bypass Validations (Use with Caution)

As a last resort, you can bypass validations entirely when creating OAuth users:

```ruby
# In app/models/concerns/clavis_user_methods.rb
def self.find_or_create_from_clavis(auth_hash)
  # ... existing code ...
  
  # Create a new user if none exists
  if user.nil?
    # ... set user attributes ...
    
    # Bypass validations
    user.save(validate: false)
  end
  
  # ... remainder of method ...
end
```

This approach isn't recommended as it might bypass important validations, but can be necessary in complex scenarios.

#### Database Setup

The Clavis generator automatically adds an `oauth_user` boolean field to your User model to help track which users were created through OAuth:

```ruby
# This is added automatically by the generator
add_column :users, :oauth_user, :boolean, default: false
```

This field is useful for conditional logic related to authentication methods.

### Session Management

```ruby
Clavis.configure do |config|
  config.session_key = :clavis_current_user_id
  config.user_finder_method = :find_or_create_from_clavis
end
```

### The OauthIdentity Model

Clavis stores OAuth credentials and user information in a polymorphic `OauthIdentity` model. This model has a `belongs_to :authenticatable, polymorphic: true` relationship, allowing it to be associated with any type of user model.

For convenience, the model also provides `user` and `user=` methods that are aliases for `authenticatable` and `authenticatable=`:

```ruby
# These are equivalent:
identity.user = current_user
identity.authenticatable = current_user
```

This allows you to use `identity.user` in your code even though the underlying database uses the `authenticatable` columns.

#### Key features of the OauthIdentity model:

- Secure token storage (tokens are automatically encrypted/decrypted)
- User information stored in the `auth_data` JSON column
- Automatic token refresh capabilities
- Unique index on `provider` and `uid` to prevent duplicate identities

### Webhook Providers
