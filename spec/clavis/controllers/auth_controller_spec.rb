# The Clavis::AuthController should be tested in the context of a Rails application
# by creating a dummy Rails app or using the engine's dummy app functionality.
#
# Examples of tests that should be run in a Rails application:
# - Testing the callback action processes OAuth responses correctly
# - Testing error handling and redirects
# - Testing session management
RSpec.describe "Clavis::AuthController", type: :controller, rails: true do
