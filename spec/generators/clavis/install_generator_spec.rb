# The Clavis::Generators::InstallGenerator is a Rails generator that creates:
# - An initializer file with configuration
# - Database migrations for OAuth identities
# - Any other files needed for Clavis integration
#
# Testing generators requires a Rails application environment with the
# Rails::Generators::TestCase functionality.

    # In a Rails environment, we would test:
    # - File generation (initializer, migration)
    # - Content of generated files
    # - Proper namespacing and configuration options
